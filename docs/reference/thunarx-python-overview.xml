    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Writing a thunarx-python extension is a fairly straight-forward process. 
    One simply imports the Thunarx module and creates a class which is derived from a number 
    of the Thunarx module's classes. When an extension derives a class, it becomes a "provider", 
    telling Thunarx to ask it for information. There are several types of providers 
    available for extensions to use: there is MenuProvider, PropertyPageProvider, RenamerProvider,
    and PreferencePageProvider, all of which will be explained 
    in more detail below. Your class can be derived from multiple providers.</para>
    
    <para>Here are the basic steps:</para>
    
    <para>1. A script is written and installed to the standard python extensions install path</para>
    <para>2. Thunar is (re)started and loads the thunarx-python C extension, which in turn loads all python extensions</para>
    <para>3. Any python script in the standard python extensions install path that imports the Thunarx module and derives 
    the main class from a Thunarx module class will be loaded</para>
    
    <note>
<title>Where to install python extensions</title>

<para>As of thunarx-python 0.3.0, python extensions are installed in $XDG_DATA_DIR/thunarx-python/extensions where $XDG_DATA_DIR 
        could be /usr/share for a global install or ~/.local/share for a local install.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
<para>As of thunarx-python 0.5.0, python extensions are loaded in the following order:

  1. $XDG_DATA_HOME/thunarx-python/extensions
  2. thunar_prefix/share/thunarx-python/extensions
  3. $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thunarx-python/extensions
  4. THUNARX_EXTENSION_DIR/python (i.e. /usr/lib64/thunarx-3/python)</para>

        <title>thunarx-3</title>
        <para>As of thunar v1.7.0, thunarx requires Gtk+3 and no longer accepts gtk.Actions.  Instead, it expects Thunarx.MenuItems.</para>

        <title>python3</title>
        <para>As of thunarx-python v0.5.0, thunarx-python can be built to embed python3 instead of python2.  It uses the $PYTHON environment variable to determine which library to use.</para>
