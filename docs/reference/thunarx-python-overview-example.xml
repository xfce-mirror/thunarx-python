    <title>A Simple Extension</title>

    <para>Create an empty file with the following code:</para>
    
    <example>
        <title>A Simple Extension</title>
        <programlisting>
from gi.repository import GObject, Gtk, Thunarx

class ThunarxMenuProviderPlugin(GObject.GObject, Thunarx.MenuProvider):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_file_menu_items(self, window, files):
        item = Thunarx.MenuItem(name="TMP:TestFileAction", label="Python File Action", tooltip='', icon=Gtk.STOCK_FILE)
        item.connect("activate", self.__do_something, window)

        return [item]

    def get_folder_menu_items(self, window, folder):
        return [Thunarx.MenuItem(name="TMP:TestFolderAction", label="Python Folder Action", tooltip='', icon=Gtk.STOCK_OPEN)]

    def __do_something(self, item, window):
        print "Doing something"
        </programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>Save this file as TestExtension.py in the $XDG_DATA_DIR/thunarx-python/extensions folder or ~/.local/share/thunarx-python/extensions.
    You may need to create this folder. To run, open the terminal and type:</para>
    
    <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
$ killall thunar
$ thunar</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Once Thunar starts, right-click on a file and you should see a new menu item, 
    "Python File Action". It is as simple as that!</para>
    
    <para>As mentioned above, in order to 
    get loaded by Thunar, a python extension must import the Thunarx module, 
    create a class derived from a Thunarx *Provider, then create the methods that 
    will be called by Thunar when it requests information from its providers. 
    In this case, when someone right-clicks on a file, Thunar will ask all of its 
    MenuProviders for additional menu items to show the user. When folders or files are clicked, 
    the get_file_menu_items method is called and a list of Thunarx.MenuItem objects is expected.</para>
