Thunarx Python Bindings

These bindings allow one to create python plugins for Thunar.

As of v0.4.0 the thunarx-python bindings will only work with Gtk+3
and Thunar v1.7.  To use these with Gtk+2, make sure to use thunarx-python v0.3.0.

As of v0.5.0 the thunarx-python bindings can be built with either python3
or python2 support.  Ensure the $PYTHON environment variable is pointed
at your preferred python executable before running configure or autogen.

Install
-----------
To install, run the following commands:
  $ ./configure (or ./autogen.sh if building from git)
  $ make
  $ make install
  
If you have built Thunar into a non-standard prefix, thunarx-python will be
installed there, but make sure pkg-config knows where it is.  You may have to 
update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to include your Thunar's 
pkgconfig path.

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/thunar_prefix/lib/pkgconfig"

Running Extensions
------------------
As of thunarx-python 0.5.0, scripts are loaded in the following order:

  1. $XDG_DATA_HOME/thunarx-python/extensions
  2. thunar_prefix/share/thunarx-python/extensions
  3. $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thunarx-python/extensions
  4. THUNARX_EXTENSION_DIR/python (i.e. /usr/lib64/thunarx-3/python)

Simply copy your python scripts into that folder and restart Thunar.

Dependencies
------------
 * Thunar (1.7.0 or later)
 * pygobject (3.20.0 or later)
 * gtk+3 (3.20.0 or later)
 
Debugging
-----------
To enable debug mode, start Thunar with the following command:

  $ THUNARX_PYTHON_DEBUG=all /path/to/thunar
